    - .beforeEach()
    - .afterEach()

### Chai
This is how to use assertions in JavaScript using Chai.
Used for Unit Testing.

I learned:
What is an assertion and why is it required?
How to install Chai from terminal or command line interface.
Understand the difference about assertion styles provided by Chai, which are 
    - assert
    - expect, and 
    - should. 
Also should extras, and configurations.

In the end I learned how to add Chai to an existent project and how assertion can be handled centrally in a project.
